# Forms reactive assignment

##  Create a Form with the following Controls and Validators
 * Project Name (should not be empty)
 * Mail (should not be a empty and a valid email)
 * Project Status Dropdown, with three values: 'Stable', 'Critical', 'Finished'
 * Submit Button
 * Add your own Validator which doesn't allow "Test" as a Project Name
 * Also implement that Validator as an async Validator (replace the other one)
 * Upon submitting the form, simply print the value to the console
